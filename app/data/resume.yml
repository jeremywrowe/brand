bio: >
  I am a developer that loves to help take products and teams to the next level. I've built applications of differing scales, languages, and domains.
  My favorite place to be is in uncharted territory. When presented with a challenging programming problem, I typically write automated tests to get
  a deeper understanding of the issue. I strive to keep applications simple, understandable, performant, and secure. I enjoy working as part of a
  team that collaborates to create innovative solutions to complex problems. I am a Ruby on Rails developer at heart, but am happy to take on the challenge
  of other languages. I try to learn a new one every year!
