      At Citrix I worked on and managed several products and supporting products. (RightSignature, ShareFile)
      I started off as a senior developer and was moved into a management position. As I went down the management
      path, I still stayed completely hands on, helping developers level up. I worked with TypeScript, Ruby on Rails,
      and C Sharp.
