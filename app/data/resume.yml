bio: >
  I am a developer that loves to help take products and teams to the next level. I've built applications of differing scales, languages, and domains.
  My favorite place to be is in uncharted territory. When presented with a challenging programming problem, I typically write automated tests to get
  a deeper understanding of the issue. I strive to keep applications simple, understandable, performant, and secure. I enjoy working as part of a
  team that collaborates to create innovative solutions to complex problems. I am a Ruby, Elixir, and JavaScript developer at heart, but am happy to take
  on the challenge of other languages. I try to learn a new programming language every year, Rust is this years - It's been pretty fun so far.

      At Citrix I maintained several products including RightSignature and ShareFile. Using a wide variety
      of technologies including TypeScript, Ruby on Rails, and C Sharp. Most recently I lead, and maintain the search
      platform for ShareFile. This involves optimizing queries, building robust scalable systems, and mentoring developers.
      The search platform powered one of Citrix most important initiatives and spanned across a suite of products. The search platform
      was a large legacy ElasticSearch system that was modernized. My core function while leading the search team was to extract
      a search service that could facilitate current and future needs.
