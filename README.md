# Brand

This is a pretty simple rails application that houses my (@jeremywrowe) experience and some blurbs about me. The data for the application is YAML backed and is shared between the Rails view and a Prawn PDF view. You can view the results at http://brand.jeremyrowe.com and http://brand.jeremyrowe.com/resume.pdf. I got sick of keeping my work experience up to date on LinkedIn so I built a little tool to do it. You can totally rip it off and use it for yourself, please just let people know where you grabbed it from. You can change data [here](https://github.com/jeremywrowe/brand/blob/master/app/data/resume.yml) after forking the project.

This application was built with:

Bulma (https://bulma.io/)
FontAwesome (https://fontawesome.com/)
Prawn (http://prawnpdf.org/api-docs/2.0/)
Ruby on Rails (https://rubyonrails.org/)
